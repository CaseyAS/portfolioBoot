# Welcome to my homework project!
    Hi, my name is Casey and this homework project is about me. You can find out more info on me on the very first page of this project. Have a look!

# Project description
    This is a remake of a portfolio project using Bootstrap instead of a CSS stylesheet. Though I did end up using a lot of <style> in my html, most for the design here is rendered with Bootstrap.

# learning new things
    Learning the Bootstrap lingo definately has a learning curve. But once I played with it for a while, it almost feels like cheating. Setting up the contact form was super simple.

# Work in progress
    Im fairly happy with everything, though there are a couple things I need to work on. For instance, the contact form in the contact.html doesnt actually work at the momment. Another thing that bothers me is the spacing of the content in portfolio.html, it dosnt prefectly line up with the navigation links at the top.

# First README
    I didnt get to the README for the first homework assignment, I hope what I ahve outlined here is proper README etiquette.
